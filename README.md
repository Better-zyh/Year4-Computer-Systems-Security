# Guide of Can304 Group Project Code 

## 1. Files Introduction
This package consists of three python files
1. **can304.py**:Code of algorithms for encryption and decryption 
2. **main.py**:Starter of the program
3. **mainwindow.py**:User interface
## 2. How to run the code
### 2.1 Environment and Packages
Python3, sys, QApplication, QMainWindow, QtCore, QtGui, QtWidgets
### 2.2 Download Packages
In order to have a GUI, the necessary packages are required, the installation command are list as follow, you can download them in the terminal

窶義``
pip3 install PyQt5 -i https://pypi.douban.com/simple
窶義``

窶義``
pip3 install PyQt5-tools -i https://pypi.douban.com/simple
窶義``
### 2.3 Open main.py
Click run in the IDE, the GUI should be showed
### 2.4 Input plaintext and key on the left
If either plaintext or key is empty, encryption function will be invalid
### 2.5 Click Encryption to encrypt the plaintext
After clicking, the cipher will appear on the right
### 2.6 Click Decryption to decrypt the cipher
After clicking, the original plaintext will appear on the right
## 3. Some Testing Cases for Validation
